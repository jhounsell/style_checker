# Style checker for Content Designers

This tool is a set of regex rules hosted inside GOV.UK prototype kit, run using javascript. It allows Content Designers working in the Home Office to check content from anywhere against the:
* [Home Office design system content style guide](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/content-style-guide)

We're looking to add more style guides in the future.

For more detail see [the breakdown of which terms are not covered in the prototype page](app/views/hods-page.html).
Or see guidance on how the tool works on the [homepage](app/views/index.html).
